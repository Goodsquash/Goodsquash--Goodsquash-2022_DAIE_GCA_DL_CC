## Abstract

---

#### **Aim and Rationale**

The aim of this study is to test whether a virtual Jungian sandplay environment presented to psychotherapy patients undergoing treatment for PTSD has a positive effect on their CPSS (child PTSD symptom scale) scores compared to a control group that is subjected to CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) alone.

#### **Participants and Setting**

The study consists of 150 patients, aged between 18-25, age was not recorded but gender was. recorded 75 are male, 75 Female. There is an even amount across the two gender groups listed in the data. A sample of people are undergoing treatment for PTSD.

#### **Experiment Design**

The sample of 150 patients were divided into three groups. There was a Control group which involved traditional CBT treatment. The second group were the Static which involved a non-animated model content in VR. The third group was the Animated group which involved animated model content within VR. 

#### **Results Gathering**

The results were gathered from the three distinct groups over 12 weeks (about 3 months) during 50-minute treatment sessions. The PTSD results were measured using observer-rated and self-reported mechanisms. The measurements were taken at the start and end of the study  

#### **Major Findings**


#### **Findings/Implications**

If this experiment shows a similar positive therapeutic effect to non-VR Jungian Sandplay then it opens the possibility of easy access to the Jungian Sandplay therapeutic method via VR instead of having to attend a physical location to receive the therapy. Thus, VR could possibly fill the role as a useful analogue to real life Jungian Sandplay making it a much more widely available therapeutic method to alleviate PTSD.

## Introduction

---

#### **Topic and Context**

Does a virtual Jungian sandplay environment have a meaningful effect on CPSS scores in comparison to CBT.  

#### **Rationale**


#### **Hypothesis**


## Method

---

#### **Participants**

150 young adults were recruited for the study (M=75, F=75) using random sampling. They were divided into 3 groups:  

* Control (traditional CBT with no VR) 

* Static (non-animated model content with VR) 

* Animated (animated model content with VR) 

All the patients were young adults between 18 â€“ 25 years old. Gender information was recorded. All groups were of equal size. Each group was evenly split by sex (M=25, F=25). 

#### **Design**

The 3 groups underwent 12 weeks (about 3 months) of treatment for 50 minutes per week with a therapist. During that time, the participants either underwent traditional CBT or used one of the 2 VR apps (Static non-animated model content, Animated model content). PTSD measurements for all groups were measured using the observer-rated and the CPSS self-report mechanisms. Measurements were taken pre-trial and post-trial for each group.
