\hypertarget{aim-and-rationale}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Aim and
Rationale}}{Aim and Rationale}}\label{aim-and-rationale}}

The aim of this study is to test whether a virtual Jungian sandplay
environment presented to psychotherapy patients undergoing treatment for
PTSD has a positive effect on their CPSS (child PTSD symptom scale)
scores compared to a control group that is subjected to CBT (Cognitive
Behavioural Therapy) alone.

\hypertarget{participants-and-setting}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Participants and
Setting}}{Participants and Setting}}\label{participants-and-setting}}

The study consists of 150 patients, aged between 18-25, age was not
recorded but gender was. recorded 75 are male, 75 Female. There is an
even amount across the two gender groups listed in the data. A sample of
people are undergoing treatment for PTSD.

\hypertarget{experiment-design}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Experiment
Design}}{Experiment Design}}\label{experiment-design}}

The sample of 150 patients were divided into three groups. There was a
Control group which involved traditional CBT treatment. The second group
were the Static which involved a non-animated model content in VR. The
third group was the Animated group which involved animated model content
within VR.

\hypertarget{results-gathering}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Results
Gathering}}{Results Gathering}}\label{results-gathering}}

The results were gathered from the three distinct groups over 12 weeks
(about 3 months) during 50-minute treatment sessions. The PTSD results
were measured using observer-rated and self-reported mechanisms. The
measurements were taken at the start and end of the study

\hypertarget{major-findings}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Major
Findings}}{Major Findings}}\label{major-findings}}

\hypertarget{findingsimplications}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Findings/Implications}}{Findings/Implications}}\label{findingsimplications}}

If this experiment shows a similar positive therapeutic effect to non-VR
Jungian Sandplay then it opens the possibility of easy access to the
Jungian Sandplay therapeutic method via VR instead of having to attend a
physical location to receive the therapy. Thus, VR could possibly fill
the role as a useful analogue to real life Jungian Sandplay making it a
much more widely available therapeutic method to alleviate PTSD.

\hypertarget{introduction-1}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}

\hypertarget{topic-and-context}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Topic and
Context}}{Topic and Context}}\label{topic-and-context}}

Does a virtual Jungian Sandplay environment have a meaningful effect on
CPSS scores in comparison to CBT.

\hypertarget{rationale}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Rationale}}{Rationale}}\label{rationale}}

The rationale behind this study is to ascertain the possible
effectiveness of VR based therapies and their potential role in
augmenting or complementing established psychotherapies.

\hypertarget{hypothesis}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Hypothesis}}{Hypothesis}}\label{hypothesis}}

We plan to investigate the effect of VR based therapy. In this
experiment, we will test the effectiveness of VR augmented Jungian
Sandplay therapy. We expect that there is likely a significant use case
for VR based therapy in a modern therapeutic environment.

\hypertarget{participants}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Participants}}{Participants}}\label{participants}}

150 young adults were recruited for the study (M=75, F=75) using random
sampling. They were divided into 3 groups:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Control (traditional CBT with no VR)
\item
  Static (non-animated model content with VR)
\item
  Animated (animated model content with VR)
\end{itemize}

All the patients were young adults between 18 -- 25 years old. Gender
information was recorded. All groups were of equal size. Each group was
evenly split by sex (M=25, F=25).

\hypertarget{design}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Design}}{Design}}\label{design}}

The 3 groups underwent 12 weeks (about 3 months) of treatment for 50
minutes per week with a therapist. During that time, the participants
either underwent traditional CBT or used one of the 2 VR apps (Static
non-animated model content, Animated model content). PTSD measurements
for all groups were measured using the observer-rated and the CPSS
self-report mechanisms. Measurements were taken pre-trial and post-trial
for each group.

\hypertarget{materials}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Materials}}{Materials}}\label{materials}}

The groups using the VR app used a tablet with the app installed. They
were also given a pen and board to self-report their level of symptoms.

The control group just used a pen and board to self-report their
symptoms whilst attending a CBT session with a therapist.

\hypertarget{procedure}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Procedure}}{Procedure}}\label{procedure}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Each group of patients in the static, animated and control groups
  self-report their PTSD symptoms using the Child PTSD Symptom Scale
  (CPSS) before their respective therapy sessions. The attending
  therapists will also record their patient observations pre-therapy.
\item
  The static and animated groups will then use their respective VR apps
  on the tablets provided for their therapy sessions. The control group
  will attend ordinary CBT sessions.
\item
  All groups will then self-report their symptoms using the Child PTSD
  Symptom Scale (CPSS) post-therapy on the boards provided. The
  attending therapists will also record their observations post-therapy.
\end{enumerate}

Before the data set could be properly analyzed first it needed to be
cleaned to remove any errors or missing data points.

The tidyverse package was installed, tidyverse is a collection of
open-source packages used for data import, tidying, manipulation, and
data visualization.

The next step involved looking at the different headings in the data set
(gender, test\_group ,etc.).

Then the headings were checked for unique values. From the data set the
test\_group headings displayed four unique variables instead of the
three expected. A heading labelled ``Cotrol'' was the fourth unexpected
variable, this was clearly a mistake in the spelling of Control.

This was then changed using the str\_replace function which switched the
string with the correct spelling.

\begin{verbatim}
## Rows: 150
## Columns: 7
## $ ...1            <dbl> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,~

\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "character"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "Male"   "Female"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "Static"   "Control"  "Cotrol"   "Animated"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "Static"   "Control"  "Animated"
\end{verbatim}

The next step was checking for rows with missing values and removing
those rows from the data to avoid errors in the results. From the
summary function we see that there is one missing value in the
pre\_trail\_or group.

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] FALSE
\end{verbatim}

The entire data set was checked by using the is.na function on the excel
file. That printed a long list False results only showing one True
statement in row 144 under the pre\_trail\_or heading meaning that is
where the missing value was located.

To remove the row the following statement was used. daie\_ca3\_data\_10
\textless-daie\_ca3\_data\_10 \%\textgreater\% drop\_na()

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 0

Below is the summary of the results from the patient's data. From an
initial look at the statistical analysis that the mean output for pre
trail Observer-Rated (OR) and pre trail Child PTSD Symptom Scale Self
Report Version had higher values than the post trail results. This is
for the overall group; further analysis is needed to find the values for
each group.

To check for normal distribution in the population a histogram was
created for the test groups row of numbers. To create this the following
function was used.

This was applied to the 4 stages of the assessments used on the
participants.

The data was shown to be normally distributed across the 4 trials The
normality test shows that the data is normally distributed since the
graph bars are symmetrical in each of the graphs for the Trial Data.

\hypertarget{magnitude-and-direction-of-results}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Magnitude and Direction of
Results}}{Magnitude and Direction of Results}}\label{magnitude-and-direction-of-results}}

The results of the box plot show a decrease in the quartile ranges as
the scale shows that the middle quartile is lower for all three groups
int the Post CPSS group. The same is shown for the Pre and Post OR group

Visually looking at the histograms for each of the test groups and the
test results show that the scores in the post trials for all groups have
lowers mean as they are distributed lower on the score scale on the
graphs.
